rom extension extractor
with fontdump (to extract the fonts from your video bios roms)
(yes yes it's gpl, find your copy of the license somewhere on www.gnu.org)

you might ask yourself why i collect x86 rom extensions.. well
i got the answer from #sparc on opn
00:19 <Elsty> Ah, I understand now.  It's like collecting butterflies.

make sure you can read /dev/mem (be root)
chmod +x ree
./ree

or use the c version (much faster, and does checksum on the rom extension)
make #or gcc ree -o ree.bin
./ree.bin

will scan your system memory, address c0000 - f0000 in 512 steps for
identification of rom extensions (55,aa), if found it will calculate
its size (byte after id, multiplied by 512) and save that to a .rom file.

ported to shell from the pascal version of 1997
original (dos/win9x) version is ree.exe and ree.pas in ree.zip

see http://www.firmware.com/support/bios/romext.htm for more info
extracts system, scsi, video bios

note
as most system bios are bigger than 64k nowadays (128k or 256k) and them
are only 64k memory window reserved, they are not dumped completely, if
anyone knows how to dump the completely, please contact me

also if you happen to know how to dump the openbootprom from sparc machines,
contact me as well

maybe you want to do your own rom extension?
